## Phase 1 – Weeks 1-2
- Set up folders for all five packs so every prefix follows the same rules.
- Write the shared helper tools like `validate-snippets.js` and the launch configs.
- Pick one README outline and reuse it across all projects.

## Phase 2 – Weeks 3-6
- Week 3: Finish Pure Ruby Snippets with Ruby 3 code, concurrency, pattern matching, and data classes.
- Week 4: Ship the Rails pack covering models, controllers, views, routes, jobs, and tests.
- Week 5: Launch the Sinatra and Hanami packs with routing, templates, middleware, and repositories.
- Week 6: Polish any remaining snippets and confirm documentation/screenshots are current.

## Phase 3 – Weeks 7-8
- Run validation and smoke tests for each pack inside VS Code.
- Update docs with screenshots or GIFs and clear install steps.
- Prepare marketplace listings, changelog notes, and migration reminders.
- Collect feedback, plan follow-up fixes, and set dates for the next releases.

## Shared Rules
- Prefixes: `rb-`, `rails-`, `sinatra-`, `hanami-`; retire outdated prefixes.
- Style: Ruby 3 hash syntax, numbered block params, pattern matching, fiber examples.
- Testing: confirm triggers, tab-stop order, unique names, and doc accuracy.
